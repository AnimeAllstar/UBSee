###  Adding new subjects

Added a new subject is not too challenging (it's just monotonous) since we have written multiple simple scripts to aid in doing so at `./scripts/`

There are a few steps in adding a new subject:
- run `npm run add [SUBJECT ID]` to add a base json file with an empty *prereqs* fields
- add the prerequisite expressions for each course in the json **manually**
- rename the file to [SUBJECT ID].json
- run `npm run test [SUBJECT ID]` to test your json. Read comments in the script file to understand what the tests do
- run `npm run fix [SUBJECT ID] [COURSE #]` for each course to add missing courses in the JSON
  - if the course is still not found, then remove the course from the prereq expression (since the data is unavailable)
- add [SUBJECT ID].json to course.json
- run the server and click all nodes to make sure that an error is not thrown
- make a pull request making sure you describe any important details

Make sure you read and understand what the scripts do. Unfortunately, because UBC doesn't officially provide the data, courses and subject need to be manually added for now.  

Make sure to submit a pull request if you think you can improve the process of adding new subjects.
